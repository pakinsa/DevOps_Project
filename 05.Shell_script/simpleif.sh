# SIMPLE IF STATEMENT
# Enclose variables and strings in double quotes to prevent word splitting and globbing
# use spaces around the brackets and the operators in the test expression
# $ sign is used to access the value of variable, not to declare it
# Use -eq or = to compare strings or numbers, not ==. The ==operator is used for pattern matching, not equality testing.
# Should be consistent with capitalisation for your variables. Name is differet from NAME

#echo "What is your name ?" 
#read NAME

#if [ $NAME = "Brostle" ]
#then 
#    echo "Welcome Brostle to Darey.io"
#else 
#    echo "Kindly, visit www.darey.io to signup"
#fi    # Use fi to close your if then statement
